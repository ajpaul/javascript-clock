# javascript-clock
A small clock app made to test out some different ways of doing things and to keep myself busy over the holidays.

## To-do
* Update the clock look
  * Something is a little off with the clock hand visual appearance
  * Get the digital clock to be vertically centered as well
* Change the rest of the app scheme
* Add social media side bar
